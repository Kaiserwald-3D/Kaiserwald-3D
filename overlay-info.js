While it is lacking in detail and resolution, the barracks, the railway to the west, the road to the south and the forest to the east indicate that this was the camp. <br><br>You can observe the similarities by slowly moving the slider towards the present. <br><br>Source: National Archives and Records Administration.",

      "There are no remains of Kaiserwald left today, as the camp has since been demolished. In the place of barracks, there are now apartment buildings. However, a memorial has been built south of the former camp, to commemorate its victims. <br><br>The church, located just east of the monument, and the railway to the west are the only modern reference points of the camp, since they are visible on both the hand-drawn map and aerial photo.",
